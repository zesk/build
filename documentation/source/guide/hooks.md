Hooks are ways to change default behaviors in scripts, or just do something at a certain time.

All hooks should be in your project root located at `bin/hooks` (This also can be overwritten or added to.) Hooks can be
any type of executable but the file should be marked executable (`chomd +x`)

If build has a default behavior for your hook, it's located at `bin/build/hooks`.

> IMPORTANT: Environment `BUILD_HOOK_EXTENSIONS` must contain `sh` to if you want `bin/build/hooks` default hooks to run
> in your project. The default value is `sh`.

Most hooks are *optional* unless specified.

## [Version Hooks](../tools/version.md)

- `version-already` - Run code when `releaseNew` is run but a new release already exists.
- `version-created` - This hook is run when `releaseNew` creates a new release.
- `version-current` - Outputs a string which displays the current application version. Default hook uses the
  `docs/release` directory.
- `version-live` - The current published live version of the software. (Optional but **highly recommended.**)
- `version-notes` - When a new release notes file needs to be generated, this generates the new file if you want
  something custom.
- `version-notes-copyright` - And, if you want to have a custom copyright line, just add this hook.

## [Application Hooks](../tools/application.md)

- `application-environment` - Create the environment file. Default calls `environmentFileApplicationMake` with your
- `application-files` - List all files which are related to `code` or behavior of the application. Should *not* include
- `application-fingerprint` - Generate a unique ID which represents the code in an application and changes when the code
  changes
- `application-tag` - The current tagged version of the software (e.g `v1.0.0rc71`)
- `application-id` - Returns a string checksum of the current application source code (unique checksum for code state)
- `maintenance` - Turn on or off maintenance
- `notify` - Notify administrator of something important

## Development Hooks

- `project-activate` - **Sourced**. When a project is activated - e.g. switching to starting development in this project.
- `project-deactivate` - **Sourced**. When a project is deactivated - e.g. switching to ANOTHER project for development.

## [Deployment Hooks](../tools/deploy.md)

- `deploy-start` - Run on deployed system. Begin deployment, after maintenance has been enabled (delete caches, etc.)
- `deploy-finish.sh` After new code is deployed (update local files or register server etc.)
- `deploy-confirm.sh` After new code is deployed make sure it is running correctly
- `deploy-activate` - Run on deployed system. During deployment install passed directory as new version of the app in
  current directory
- `deploy-finish` - Run on deployed system. Deployment is finished (before maintenance is turned off)
- `deploy-confirm` - Run on pipeline systems. Before finish, check that deployment succeeded remotely via an alternate
  mechanism (smoke tests)
- `deploy-cleanup` - Run on deployed system. After deployment, delete stray files from deployment if needed.
- `deploy-link` - Links a version of the application to a symbolic link to enable fast application version switching.
- `deploy-revert` - Run on deployed system. After failed deployment, revert to previous version.

## Documentation Hooks

- `documentation-complete` - The `documentationBuild` completed successfully.
- `documentation-error` - The `documentationBuild` completed with errors.

## Vendor Hooks

- `git-pre-commit` - A git pre-commit hook. Install it with `gitInstallHooks`.
- `git-post-commit` - A git post-commit hook. Install it with `gitInstallHooks`.
- `github-release-before` - Run before [`github-release`](hooks/github-release.md) release the release to GitHub.
- `github-release-after` - Run after [`github-release`]( hooks/github-release.md) release the release to GitHub.

## Language Pre-Commit Hooks

- `pre-commit-php` - Run on PHP files before commit. Fixes all file modes and runs `php-cs-fixer`.
- `pre-commit-sh` - Run on Bash files before commit. `bashSanitize` on all files.

## [Testing Hooks](hooks/test.md)

- `test-setup` - Move or copy files prior to docker-compose build to build test container
- `test-runner` - Run unit and any other tests inside the container (Required for test scripts)
- `test-cleanup` - Reverse of `test-setup` hook actions
