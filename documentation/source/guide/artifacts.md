## Build Directory and `.deploy`

A `.build/` directory is created at a configured location set by the environment variable `BUILD_CACHE`. If not set, it
uses `XDG_CACHE_HOME` directory, which defaults to a standard directory.

You can preserve the build directory post-build to see any details. Most failures will still output the log, but they
will not be output to your primary build log unless a failure occurs.

A top-level `.deploy` directory is created for build steps and contains metadata about the deployment. This is always
created in the project root and the expectation is that it will be included in any deployments as metadata (not
required, however).

## `.build.env`

A docker-compatible `.env` file which is:

- Generated by `phpBuild`
- Used by `deployBuildEnvironment` if present 
- Zesk Build generates for own build (by `bin/build.sh`)
