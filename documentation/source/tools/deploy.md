## Deployment Hooks

Deployment occurs as follows:

- `make-env` - Optional. Run on deployment system. Create environment file for remote system.
- `deploy-start` - Optional. Run on each remote system.
- `deploy-activate` - Optional. Run on each remote system.
- `deploy-finish` - Optional. Run on each remote system.
- `deploy-confirm` - Optional. Run on deployment system.
- `deploy-revert` - Optional. Run on each remote system.

## Ordering of Hooks

Hooks are run, in this order:

### Deployment `deployApplication`

Most `deploy-foo` hooks should handle failure and return application state to a **stable** state.

1. `maintenance` `on` - On each deployed system
    - Fail: Nothing
2. `deploy-shutdown` - On each deployed system
    - Fail: `maintenance` `off`
3. `deploy-start` - On each deployed system
    - Fail: `maintenance` `off`
4. `deploy-activate` - On each deployed system
    - Fail: `maintenance` `off`
5. `deploy-finish` - On each deployed system
    - Fail: `maintenance` `off`
6. `maintenance` `off` - On each deployed system
    - Fail: Nothing

### Deployment `deployRemoteFinish`

Most `deploy-foo` hooks should handle failure and return application state to a **stable** state.

1. `deploy-cleanup` - On each deployed system
    - Fail: Nothing
