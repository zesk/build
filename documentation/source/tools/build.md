These tools are if you wish to write your own installer for your own software in `bash` using **Zesk Build**.

Copy `install-bin-build.sh` and rename, keep up to date in your own project with `bin/build/identical-repair.sh --internal`.

{_installRemotePackage}
{installInstallBinary}

It will download and install your package as outlined in [building your own installer](../guide/installer.md)
