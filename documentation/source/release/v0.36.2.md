# Zesk Build release v0.36.2

> Copyright &copy; 2025 Market Acumen, Inc.

- Previous version: v0.36.1
- Making `interactiveBashSource` more verbose
- Made `buildEnvironmentLoad` (and also `buildEnvironmentGet`) always load relative paths from the home directory as
  `cd` breaks this function
- Added `--cd-away` for `testSuite`
- Fixed all tests for `--cd-away` flag
- Converted `mariadbInstall` to a `packageGroupInstall` call and provided initial mappings
- Refactored Install calls and moved to named files
- Issue with `_undo` not allowing `0` for exit code despite usefulness to use this to simply clean up things which need
  to be cleaned up anyway; so `_undo` now allows an exit code of `0` (which the docs said it allowed previously)
- Adding `mariadb` Darwin install notes to codebase for reference
- `hostIPList` -> `networkIPList`
- Added `networkMACAddressList` and `network.sh` and related
- Renamed `timestampToDate` to `dateFromTimestamp`- Documentation review and cleanup.
