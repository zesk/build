# Zesk Build release v0.38.4

> Copyright &copy; 2025 Market Acumen, Inc.

- Previous version: v0.38.3
- Docs updates
- `backgroundProceess` handles errors better (missing `.stop` files)
- Cleanup of `awsIPAccess` output
- `mapEnvironment` was massively optimized, and now handles bad environment variables just fine thanks.
- turns out the `plumber` was sleeping on the job so fixed that and now works again
- `isAbsolutePath` -> `pathIsAbsolute`
- Leaking changes to `LINES` or `COLUMNS` no longer outputs anything as it is common and can be caused by terminal
  resize
- Added `stringBegins` and `stringBeginsInsensitive`
- Fixed a lot of leaks the `plumber` had missed in previous builds.
- Pretty sure sped up documentation build like 5x or better
