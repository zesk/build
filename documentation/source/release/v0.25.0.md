# Release v0.25.0

- Documentation now uses `mkdocs` which is awesome
- Consider moving most `documentation` functionality to another language. Bash is slow.
- adding type checking to `version-already` and `version-created` default hooks
- `bashPromptUser` -> `bashUserInput`
- removing prompt from code
- Added exit codes directory for documentation, maybe
- documentation paths changed in source code
- `beginTiming` -> `timingStart`
- `reportTiming` -> `timingReport`
- `version-already` hook now adds lines containing the version number to the top of the `deprecated.txt` file automatically
- more granular assert timing
- Adding timing tests and timing of tests is also now in milliseconds
- `testSuite --tap` adds TAP output to testing
- `testTools` now loads `assert` and other test functions dynamically
- Added better error capture, some odd errors with `set -eou pipefail` I believe
- `loopExecute` added
- `boxedHeading --outside outsideColor --inside insideColor` feature added
- `timingStart`, `timingReport` and `timingFormat` no longer cause any errors
- adding version and build time to docs
- apk test
- Removed issue with docker images on older versions of docker
- `bigText` no longer does package calls, set up `BUILD_TEXT_BINARY` first
- adding rsync simple integration
- Fixing issue with incorrect handler in `__catchCode`
- adding __catchCode test which was broken last release
- Fixed issue with `environmentFileShow`
- `testDocSections` fix and `fg: no job control` fix
- Figured out why log file was going missing `/opt/atlassian/pipelines/agent/build/bin/build/tools/test/tools.sh: line 794: 2/root/.cache/.build/testSuite.log: No such file or directory` during test - bad redirect `2`
- `aws` fails if `PAGER` is set to a invalid value so must explicitly ignore
- `bash-build.sh` binary loads bash with everything loaded and preconfigures `.bashrc`
- `aws` issues were due to defaults not being hidden, new globals in AWS now hidden
- Fixed warning in `bashPromptModule_dotFilesWatcher`
- fixing buildFailed
- attempting to fix mysterious timing errors
- Minor tweaks to docs build.
- docs are no longer built as part of the release into the code
