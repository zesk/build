# Release v0.25.0

- Documentation now uses `mkdocs` which is awesome
- Consider moving most `documentation` functionality to another language. Bash is slow.
- adding type checking to `version-already` and `version-created` default hooks
- `bashPromptUser` -> `bashUserInput`
- removing prompt from code
- Added exit codes directory for documentation, maybe
- documentation paths changed in source code
- `beginTiming` -> `timingStart`
- `reportTiming` -> `timingReport`
- `version-already` hook now adds lines containing the version number to the top of the `deprecated.txt` file automatically
- more granular assert timing
