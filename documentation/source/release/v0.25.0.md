# Release v0.25.0

- Documentation now uses `mkdocs` which is awesome
- Consider moving most `documentation` functionality to another language. Bash is slow.
- adding type checking to `version-already` and `version-created` default hooks
- `bashPromptUser` -> `bashUserInput`
- removing prompt from code
- Added exit codes directory for documentation, maybe
- documentation paths changed in source code
- `beginTiming` -> `timingStart`
- `reportTiming` -> `timingReport`
- `version-already` hook now adds lines containing the version number to the top of the `deprecated.txt` file automatically
- more granular assert timing
- Adding timing tests and timing of tests is also now in milliseconds
- `testSuite --tap` adds TAP output to testing
- `testTools` now loads `assert` and other test functions dynamically 
- Added better error capture, some odd errors with `set -eou pipefail` I believe
- `loopExecute` added
- `boxedHeading --outside outsideColor --inside insideColor` feature added
- `timingStart`, `timingReport` and `timingFormat` no longer cause any errors
