# Release v0.25.10

## Decisions about architecture (`.env.foo` vs `.foo.env`)

- [.env files conventions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55458239/naming-convention-for-environment-variables-files) appear to be different, we will adopt the extension route
- `dotenv` Node package prefers `.env.production` - preference should be honored if needed later
- Research other conventions used in other packages (Python or PHP for example)?

Zesk Build uses `.build.env` for application environment builds (the `.env` extension is common in file systems).

## Other changes

- Upgrade from v0.25.9
- New snazzy features here
- Added `deprecatedFilePrependVersion`
- Removed deprecated `--env` option from `crontabApplicationUpdate` (use `--env-file`)
- When tests failed hook `test-bash-pass` was called incorrectly, it now correctly calls `test-bash-fail`
- `.env.STAGING` -> `.STAGING.env` (also `PRODUCTION`, `staging` and `production` are moved during deprecation)
- `deprecatedCannon` now correctly displays the changes and newlines correctly
- `bashLintFiles` now shows errors immediately
- `_undo` had a bug where it would not run when *not* terminated with a `--` - now works.
- Renamed test suite functions which did not match `test` or `_` prefixes
