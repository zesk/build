> Copyright &copy; 2026 Market Acumen, Inc.

- Previous version: v0.38.2
- Fixed documentation version
- `__decorateStyle` does not require `isArray` anymore
- `identical-repair.sh` now works when no JSON
- Added clean up to temporary files in `testSuite` (although `incrementor` directory is still being left around)
- `phpComposerInstall` now also installs PHP if it is not installed
- parallel steps for production build
- Fixed filter for tests
- removed `aws` requirement from build steps where not used
- Adding `--env-file` as not sure if environment is preserved between steps on BB pipelines
- playing with build sizing (`bitbucket-pipelines.yml`) and made production build parallel
- Added some `slow` tests to balance timing of tests
- `Exit Code:` -> `Return Code:`
- Updating test tags so they do not overlap `slow` and `package-install`
