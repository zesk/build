# Release v0.25.3

- Fixing first installer "blank message" (no reason for installation) - also if no directory does not check remote version first to see if the version needs to be upgraded.
- `outputTrigger` was broken in v0.25.3 due to lack of testing and a typo. Now tested and no typo.
- Look into coverage support at some point...
- `gitCommit` now actually pulls the comment from the last comment in the release notes if not specified, making life easier
- Adding `environmentAddFile`
- `confirmYesNo` was exiting immediately due to use of milliseconds vs seconds; fixed
- Removed instances of `__echo` which are no longer required in code
- Old deprecated function `_environmentOutput` now AOK
