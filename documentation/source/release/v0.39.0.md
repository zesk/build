# Zesk Build release v0.39.0

> Copyright &copy; 2025 Market Acumen, Inc.

- Previous version: v0.38.3
- Major documentation.sh updates and speed improvements
- `backgroundProceess` handles errors better (missing `.stop` files)
- Cleanup of `awsIPAccess` output
- `mapEnvironment` was massively optimized, and now handles bad environment variables just fine thanks.
- turns out the `plumber` was sleeping on the job so fixed that and now works again
- `isAbsolutePath` -> `pathIsAbsolute`
- Leaking changes to `LINES` or `COLUMNS` no longer outputs anything as it is common and can be caused by terminal
  resize
- Added `stringBegins` and `stringBeginsInsensitive`
- Fixed a lot of leaks the `plumber` had missed in previous builds.
- Pretty sure sped up documentation build like 5x or better
- renamed underscore functions to first-class ones
- Removed and deprecated `__environment`
- `exitString` -> `returnCodeString`
- `newRelease` -> `releaseNew`
- Renamed sugar functions to first-class:
    - `__catchEnvironment` -> `catchEnvironment`
    - `__catchArgument` -> `catchArgument`
    - `__catch` -> `catchReturn`
    - `__catchCode` -> `catchCode`
    - `__throwEnvironment` -> `throwEnvironment`
    - `__execute|execute`
    - `__echo` -> `executeEcho`
    - `_choose` -> `booleanChoose`
- Fixing apt upgrade
- `pythonPackageInstalled` now is more robust
- Added `pushd` and `popd` around tests to avoid errors when deleting current directory after test exits
