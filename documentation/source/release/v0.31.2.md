# Release v0.31.2

- Attempt to put in suppression of installer errors when the "overwrite" of the installer file **appears** to change the script content *in memory* (cue spooky music)
- `identicalCheck` inner loop no longer triggers `too many open files` errors, I think, although still not sure what was the root cause, just refactored it.
- Not released, `_return` had a bug
