# Release v0.33.0

# Breaking changes

- `decorate color` now supports stdin and now may require an additional parameter (`--`) to avoid issues (e.g. `$(decorate code)` -> `$(decorate code --)`)
- `decorate wrap`, `decorate prefix` and `decorate suffix` added
- Changes universally to `decorate reset` -> `decorate reset --` etc. to support new `stdin` syntax
- Made assertion output a little cleaner
- Made test output less verbose, `STDERR-failed` messages removed which were redundant

# Changes

- Once again, attempting to fix the replace-self script which keeps failing with errors depending on size of source/target. Trying `exec` as the final step instead.
- `decorate color` can now be used as a pipe which will operate on each line individually.
- `wrapLines` deprecated, use `decorate wrap`
- No longer uses `xxd` for dumping, uses `od` instead (not available by default on BB pipelines)
- Added `dumpHex`
- 8x costs 8x
