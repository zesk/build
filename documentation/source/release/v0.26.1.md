# Release v0.26.1

- Fixed example in `dateAdd` documentation
- Added `--installer` to `_installRemotePackage`
- `deprecated.sh` was modifying release notes incorrectly, it now ignores them
- `awsCredentialsAdd` now correctly updates the credentials file
- First crack at `validate`
- `usageArguments` -> `usageFormatArguments` to avoid name space collision with other `usageArgumentString` functions (for example)
- Fixed singles report in `identicalCheck`
- Added `--internal-only` flag to `identicalCheckShell`
- Added `--print` to `buildEnvironmentLoad`
- build/deploy separation and addition of `--documentation` to `bin/build.sh` and `bin/deploy.sh` to isolate documentation build and push
- `developerAnnounce --list` now correctly detects and outputs `alias` names
