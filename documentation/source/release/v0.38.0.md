# Zesk Build release v0.38.0

> Copyright &copy; 2025 Market Acumen, Inc.

Major changes are the introduction of a loader to make initial loading much faster, and some internal organizational
work to move common functionality to the right place as well as keep file sizes smaller.

- Previous version: v0.37.1
- Fixed issue with `usage` -> `handler` renaming in `package.sh`
- Limiting `wrapLines` deprecation (and ALL build deprecation) to shell files and configuration files as this (and
  others) are also used in PHP files
- Adding `__catch` to core errors, adding `__throw`
- `testIdenticalThingEOFProblem` added and fixed (issue with identical repair screwing up files when last line is a `}`)
- New test timings updated, added build logging of size, added `yq` install
- Decided to move documentation to `mkdocs`
  plugin (See [packaging projects](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/))
- Moved `TEST_PLUMBER` -> `BUILD_TEST_FLAGS`, you can use semicolon-separated name/value pairs like:
  `Plumber:true;Housekeeper:false` - this mimics the same format returned by function tags (e.g.
  `# Test-Housekeeper: true`)- cleaned up `decorate each foo` -> `decorate each foo --` when needed
- Deprecated identical `argument-case-header` and `argumentUnknown` removed
- Removed functions `usageArgumentUnknown` and `usageArgumentMissing` as they were not used anywhere within the core
  code
- Removed most occurrences of `usage` and `local usage=`- testing config
- ignore `.last-run-test` in housekeeper in testing
- Added `__pcregrepBinary` to allow usage via `xargs`
- building docs requires installing package `python3-venv` to get `pip` and `venv`
- Deprecated now only looks at `.sh` (and `.md`, `.txt`, `.json`, `.conf` and `.yml`) files
- Fixed `consoleColumns` and `consoleRows` to fall back on environment variables `ROWS` and `LINES` if `stty` is not
  working, also sets `shopt -s checkwinsize` by default
- `reloadChanges` trigger was not aggressive enough when editing the same file
- `stripAnsi` support for file links
- `approve.md` added and renamed `interactiveBashSource` to `approveBashSource`, added `approvedBashSources` tool to
  show current status
- `approved` and `developer.sh` updates and fixes
- Renamed `done` variables to `finished`
- Added `isPlainy`- added tests for new paths and `isPlain`
- Removed the `--skip-terminal` option for `bashPrompt` - if you need this functionality add it before calling as it's
  unpredictable.
- Fix test for `consoleFileLink` to test against `red` not` file` for display in pipeline
- Python uninstall works correctly
- `usageGenerator` and `usageTemplate` moved to private internal names (used only internally)
- Added `junit` for future test output work
- `identical` code is now conditionally loaded- `__usageDocument` must not be recursive
- `bashLint --fix` was not working properly
- Adding platform test iteration
- On Fedora `which` and some other basics are not by default installed
- Added starting version for `yum` package manager (`yumIsInstalled`)
- Added `pythonVirtual` and fixed issue with install.
