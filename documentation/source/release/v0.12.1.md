# Release v0.12.1

- `makeShellFilesExecutable` works on current working directory now with no arguments
- Fixed issue with `bashSourcePath` and `makeShellFilesExecutable` where if given a path containing a `.` directory above the path it would not work, now it does
- allow `--leak testPasses` in `testBashSourcePathDot`
