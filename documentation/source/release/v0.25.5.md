# Release v0.25.5

- `environmentApplicationLoad` now outputs name/value pairs
- `reloadChanges` error handling and fix for SLOW repeated runs
- quieted `brew update`
- Added `developer.sh` `developer.md` and `developerTrack` `developerAnnounce` and `developerUndo` to tools
- Added `githubURLParse`, `githubProjectJSON`, `githubLatest`
- Added `reloadChanges --stop` to stop and clear this functionality
- Improved assertion times by removing plumber, see `TEST_PLUMBER` (Boolean)
- fixed issue with `gitCommit` ignoring command-line comment
- Added deprecated tools `deprecatedFind` `deprecatedCannon` `deprecatedCannonFile` and `deprecatedIgnore`
- Added tests for `deprecated-tools.sh` and related functions (in `deprecated-tests.sh`)
- Note `tools/deprecated.sh` is deprecated functions which are being phased out and `tools/deprecated-tools.sh` is the actual tools - largely due to the fact that `deprecated.sh` is easier to ignore globally
- `environmentFileApplicationMake` now works and also has new nice side effect of having no side effects on the environment
