# Release v0.2.1

- Upgrade from v0.2.0
- Tweaks to documentation
- Adding `build-setup.sh` to copy into projects
- Moved scripts into `install` (for installing components during pipeline) and `pipeline` for more complex pipeline
  steps used in other steps. `bin/build` scripts are largely tools
- Renamed `colors.sh` to `tools.sh`
- Added `env``map.sh` and `cannon.sh` tools and defined new `quoteSedString` function, related to both.

To fix (some) local code, run:

    bin/build/cannon.sh colors.sh tools.sh

other tool paths can be updated manually.
