# Release v0.33.6

- Added `mariadbDumpClean`
- Added `decorate size`
- Fixed an issue in `decorate each` which would output a final blank line which is inconsistent with how end of a stream should be handled. Fixed - it now matches the same functionality in `__executeInputSupport` which is how other decorate calls are handled.
