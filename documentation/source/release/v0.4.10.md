# Release v0.4.10

- `testShellScripts` removing `quietLog` argument
- Added `release-notes.sh` script to output current release notes
- AWS cli installation uses the `.build` directory for temporary files
- Fixing `known_hosts` in `deploy-to.sh`
- `deploy-to.sh` fails if `~/.ssh` is not created, will now create the directory if needed to populate a `known_hosts`
- `deploy-to.sh` does not require `known_hosts` file to exist first
- Release v0.4.6 did not fix the above two issues, so updated that release notes as well. Online notes were corrected.
