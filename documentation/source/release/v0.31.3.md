# Release v0.31.3

New code:

    decorate each --index code One Two Three

- `_return` now outputs on success as well
- `--line "$LINENO"` for assert calls is no longer necessary as this can use the `${BASH_LINENO[@]}` variable, and so it does
- `decorate each` now takes an optional `--index` or `--count` arguments to output the index before each item or the total count at the end
- Fixed an issue removing the last function from the `bashPrompt` would cause infinite read wait time
- Identical output clean up 
- `decorate pair` now places a color reset at the end of the line to clean up output
- 
- `buildCompletion` now handles arguments
