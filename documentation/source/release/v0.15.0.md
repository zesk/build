# Release v0.14.6

- Upgrade from v0.14.5
- New snazzy features here
- `package.sh` replaces all `apt` commands, support added for `apk` and `brew` (in testing)

## Coding shift

Going to try a new mode of local `local` - keep declarations close to their use.

Up until now - `local` variables have always been placed at the top of a function; leading to huge variable declarations
for some functions. (These can be refactored as well.)

Seems like so far it cleans up the functions, will leave fewer leaked locals and make the code a little easier to read.
