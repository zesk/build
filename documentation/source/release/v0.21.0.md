# Release v0.21.0

- copyright technically starts from starting year, change this logic everywhere
- Deprecated script was broken, fixed and cleaned up majorly
- Deprecated is now stored in a text file delimited with `|` (see `deprecated.txt`)
- `consoleColumns` does not work well with `tput cols` (can not mute errors) â€“ using `stty size` instead (more reliable?)
- Fixed issue with `decorate reset` not outputting correct stop character
- Enhanced `dumpBinary` to add nice labels like `dumpBinary` (Probably should merge these)
- Some bash test caused race condition failure in CI pipeline (`bash.env` example) now can not run at 11:59pm on new year's eve only.
- Added `--version-function` to `_installRemotePackage` to make installing faster and more efficient
- Added `hookSource` and `hookSourceOptional`
- `install-bin-build.sh` now fails more elegantly when `jq` is not available
- `decorate each` is now part of the core `_colors.sh` library
- `__help usageFunction "$@"` added for adding help to simple functions
- `__fetch` added to split dependency on `wget` or `curl`
- `identicalCheckShell` added a new token `_IDENTICAL_` to make it handle a total of three tokens in code:
    - `# IDENTICAL tokenName 1`, `# _IDENTICAL_ tokenName 1`, and `# DOC TEMPLATE: tokenName 1`
    - This allows for overlapping identical sections within templates
- `__failArgument` -> `__throwArgument` and `__usageArgument` -> `__catchArgument` renaming
- `bashDebug` major improvements
- `identicalCheck` has been refactored and simplified somewhat
- fixing `listCleanDuplicates` logic which was reversed for `--removed`
- `apk-tests.sh` are showing some errors on BitBucket Pipelines, may be `dockerImages` and `jq` - added debugging to tests
- Tried 4x and 8x build sizes
- `urlValid` was not returning error on `error=` non-blank. Now does.

## Breaking changes

- `bin/build/install` has been removed. Run `deprecated.sh`.
- A version of `install-bin-build.sh` in a recent release (`v0.20.2`?) would fail and copy a file to your home directory. Skip to this version or update the script manually.
- Changed `hookRun` to `hookRun`
- `project-activate` and `project-deactivate` hooks are now run as `hookSource` to allow for changing of the shell context (e.g. your `PATH` and shell defined variables and functions)
- Major enhancements to `confirmYesNo` and the `interactive.sh` code base (timers, cleaner output)
- ` --env ` vs ` --env-file ` is now consistent and fully deprecated, so `--env` is no longer considered a deprecated flag. `--env` is for NAME=value and `--env-file` is for files consistently now.

### `--env` for environment files iis now deprecated and will break

Use the replacement `--env-file`:

- `documentationTemplateFunctionCompile --env envFile` is NOW OBSOLETE (and will not work)
- `crontabApplicationUpdate --env envFile` is NOW OBSOLETE (and will not work)
- `documentationTemplateCompile --env envFile` is NOW OBSOLETE (and will not work)
