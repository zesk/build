# Zesk Build release v0.39.7

> Copyright &copy; 2025 Market Acumen, Inc.

- Previous version: v0.39.6
- Fixed issue with `deprecated.sh` ignoring `APPLICATION_JSON_PREFIX` - now honors it if set (optionally)
- Fixed `quoteGrepPattern` to support backslashes correctly (PHP work and namespaces, yep.)
- Added `APPLICATION_CODE_IGNORE` to ignore those pesky `vendor` and `node_modules` dirctorties when needed
- `APPLICATION_CODE_IGNORE` testing and added `--debug` testing for `hookRun application-files --debug` if you want
- Fixed issue with grep pattern in `plumber`, `--leak` was not working temporarily
