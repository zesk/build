## Other changes

- Previous version: v0.36.1
- Making `interactiveBashSource` more verbose
- Made `buildEnvironmentLoad` (and also `buildEnvironmentGet`) always load relative paths from the home directory as
  `cd` breaks this function
- Added `--cd-away` for `testSuite`
- Fixed all tests for `--cd-away` flag
- Converted `mariadbInstall` to a `packageGroupInstall` call and provided initial mappings
- Refactored installation calls and moved to named files
- Issue with `_undo` not allowing `0` for exit code despite usefulness to use this to simply clean up things which need
  to be cleaned up anyway; so `_undo` now allows an exit code of `0` (which the docs said it allowed previously)
- Adding `mariadb` Darwin install notes to codebase for reference
- `gitPreCommitSetup` fails when no files are committed but also when only commit is a delete, so changing the semantics
  of this call such that it succeeds in the zero-file case as well.
- `environmentClean` now keeps `BUILD_HOME` by default as there is no way to locate ourselves after this has been
  deleted unless we store a file somewhere globally known (bad idea probably). So, in short, avoid deleting `BUILD_HOME`
  and only change it if you know what you are doing.- many tests had --cd-away issues, added `Test-Build-Home: true`
  flag
- Added `testBuildFunctionsCoverage` which checks to make sure all build functions have at least 1 test
- Added environment for Zesk Build only (`BUILD_COVERAGE_REQUIRED_DATE`) which is a drop-dead date for testing all
  functions in Zesk Build in the test suite. Currently set for August 1, 2025.
- Added `# Test-Build-Home: true` tag for tests to require certain tests to start with CWD at `buildHome`
- Standardized on `sha1sum` for file hashing as it is installed by default on most platform images part of `coreutils`
- Added `130` - `user-interrupt` to `exitString` and `_code`
- Added `--help` check for all build functions and added `--help` handler to many of them
- Added a third internal IDENTICAL tag `__IDENTICAL__` - used for `usageDocument`
- Ensured most help use `# __IDENTICAL usageDocument 1`
- Added `notify` to call `notify` hook with useful arguments - Added improvements to `bashFunctionComment` parsing to
  avoid the newline between functions issue
- The great `--help` addition to everything, added `identicalWatch` and `--token` parameter to `identicalCheck` to make
  it much faster
- `identicalWatch` is TBD but in progress
- All calls now support `--help` and the few which semantically make no sense support help via calling without
  arguments.
