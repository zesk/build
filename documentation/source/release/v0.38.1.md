# Zesk Build release v0.38.1

> Copyright &copy; 2025 Market Acumen, Inc.

- Previous version: v0.38.0
- Fixed `reloadChanges` which appeared to be triggering every invocation for multiple directory configurations.
- Reloading Zesk Build would fail due to functions which defined whether things were loaded or not; added global
  `__BUILD_LOADER` to track what has been loaded and clears functions upon reload to ensure everything is properly
  reloaded.
- fixing options for `deploy.sh` 
- Added `fileEndsWithNewline`
- Moved internal `__documentationFormatArguments` to place it can be used
- ---- fixing doc
