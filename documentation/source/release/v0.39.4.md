# Zesk Build release v0.39.4

> Copyright &copy; 2025 Market Acumen, Inc.

- Previous version: v0.39.3
- Documentation updates
- `dockerCompose...` functions are a little smarter about newer versions of `docker` and will only install the python
  package if unsupported by the raw `docker` binary
- PHP `pre-commit` no longer sets the version in `composer.json` this is not recommended
- `developerUndo` removed from `developer.sh` until it behaves correctly. (May just bail on trying to keep bash function space clean.)
- Updated documentation for `iTerm2` and added `# DOC TEMPLATE: iTerm2IgnoreArgument` for common argument
