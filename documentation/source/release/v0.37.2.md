# Zesk Build release v0.37.2

> Copyright &copy; 2025 Market Acumen, Inc.

- Previous version: v0.37.1
- Fixed issue with `usage` -> `handler` renaming in `package.sh`
- Limiting wrapLines deprecation to shell files as this is also used in PHP files
- Adding `__catch` to core errors, adding `__throw`
- `testIdenticalThingEOFProblem` added and fixed (issue with identical repair screwing up files when last line is a `}`)
- New test timings updated, added build logging of size, added `yq` install
- Decided to move documentation to `mkdocs`
  plugin (See [packaging projects](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/))
- Moved `TEST_PLUMBER` -> `BUILD_TEST_FLAGS`, you can use semicolon-separated name/value pairs like:
  `Plumber:true;Housekeeper:false` - this mimics the same format returned by function tags (e.g.
  `# Test-Housekeeper: true`)- cleaned up `decorate each foo` -> `decorate each foo --` when needed
- Deprecated identical `argument-case-header` and `argumentUnknown`
- Removed functions `usageArgumentUnknown` and `usageArgumentMissing` as they were not used anywhere within the core
  code
- Removed most occurrences of `usage` and `local usage=`- testing config
- ignore `.last-run-test` in housekeeper in testing
- Added `__pcregrepBinary` to allow usage via xargs
- building docs requires installing package `python3-venv` to get `pip` and `venv`
