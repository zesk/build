# Zesk Build release v0.40.2

> Copyright &copy; 2026 Market Acumen, Inc.

- Previous version: v0.40.1
- Modified documentation markers to support lowercase markers now can use `{lowerFn}` in see templates
- See `{` `SEE:...` `}` in documentation now caches most results and uses file modification times to ensure everything
  is kept up to date
- Added `decoratePath --no-app $path` to skip the `BUILD_HOME` mapping when we want to know relative path to `HOME`
  only.
- Added `decoratePath --path path=icon` option
- Documentation updates to various hooks, added `BUILD_DEBUG` documentation and checked for `buildDebugEnabled`
- `fileTemporaryName` addressed `BUILD_DEBUG` as a `;`-delimited list previously, it now handles it as a `,`-delimited
  list
- Updated documentation for `{` `SEE:validate` `}`
- Attempt to fix exec `3>&-` failure
- Need a figure a way to embed See: clauses in documentation for the purpose of documentation (escaping or quoting)
- Added `--local` to `todayDate` `yesterdayDate` and `tomorrowDate` to support local times when needed. Default is UTC
  for all of these.
- ordering tests
- `backgroundProcess` appears to be leaking, added a warning
- Added more verbose file display for the `git-pre-commit` default hook
- Added test for `gitPreCommitExtensionList`
- GitHub Access token expiration date `GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE.sh` added
- Added a character extension to filters to `testSuite` tags to enable more complex filtering
    - Prefix a tag with `+` to add the meaning `previous AND`
    - `--tag foo --tag bar` means must have `foo` tag OR must have `bar` tag
    - `--tag foo --tag +bar` means must have `foo` tag AND must have `bar` tag
    - `--skip-tag foo --skip-tag bar` means skip any test with `foo` tag OR with `bar` tag (either)
    - `--skip-tag foo --skip-tag +bar` means skip any test with `foo` tag AND with `bar` tag (both)
    - The `+` means `AND the previous` so you can mix and match for more complex queries
    - `--tag a --tag +b --tag c --tag +d --tag +e` is `(a and b) or (c and d and e)`
    - (consider `--tag foo+bar` syntax maybe? - later)
- Tuned build setup and added `docs-1`, `docs-2`, and `docs-4` to test speeds of various hardware
- `documentationMkdocs` uses `pythonVirtual` now
- Added `awsS3Upload`
- `bashPromptModule_BuildProject` does not modify `PATH` anymore, do this in your `project-activate` hook or `bin/developer.sh` hook
- `2026`
