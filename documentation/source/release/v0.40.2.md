> Copyright &copy; 2025 Market Acumen, Inc.

- Previous version: v0.40.1
- Modified documentation markers to support lowercase markers now can use `{lowerFn}` in see templates
- See `{` `SEE:...` `}` in documentation now caches most results and uses file modification times to ensure everything
  is kept up to date
- Added `decoratePath --no-app $path` to skip the `BUILD_HOME` mapping when we want to know relative path to `HOME`
  only.
- Added `decoratePath --path path=icon` option
- Documentation updates to various hooks, added `BUILD_DEBUG` documentation and checked for `buildDebugEnabled`
- `fileTemporaryName` addressed `BUILD_DEBUG` as a `;`-delimited list previously, it now handles it as a `,`-delimited
  list
- Updated documentation for `{` `SEE:validate` `}`
- Attempt to fix exec `3>&-` failure
- Need a figure a way to embed See: clauses in documentation for the purpose of documentation (escaping or quoting)
- Added `--local` to `todayDate` `yesterdayDate` and `tomorrowDate` to support local times when needed. Default is UTC
  for all of these.
- ordering tests
- `backgroundProcess` appears to be leaking, added a warning
