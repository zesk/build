# Environment Variables

Note that you should place environment variables, if you override the default for example, in:

    ./bin/env/VARIABLE_NAME.sh

Where `VARIABLE_NAME` is the name of your environment variable.

These are the known environment variables in `Zesk Build` - to see the default behavior look at in `./bin/build/env`.

See also [buildEnvironmentLoad](../tools/environment.md#buildEnvironmentLoad) and [buildEnvironmentGet](../tools/environment.md#buildEnvironmentGet).
