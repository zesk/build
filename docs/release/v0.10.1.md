# Release v0.10.1

## Sugaring

- `shift || __failArgument "$usage" "missing $(consoleLabel "$argument") argument" || return $?` when `[ $# -gt 0 ]` never fails and no way to do so. Removing from `example.sh`.
- Added `--help` to `deployBuildEnvironment`
- `incrementor` `--help` now works
- Finally added `deployment-tests.sh` should save iteration on builds
- Test output cleanup

## Bugs

- Fixing user host issue with `deployBuildEnvironment`
- Fix semantics of `incrementor a b 1 c` which used to output `1 1 1` `2 1 1` `3 1 1` but should output `2 2 1`, `3 3 1` and now does.
