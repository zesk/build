# Release v0.7.3

- `dockerLocalContainer` had and error `./bin/build/tools/docker.sh: line 248: tempEnvs: unbound variable`
- `bin/build/pipeline/php-build.sh: line 205: envVars[@]: unbound variable` Fixed
- Moved PHP code into `tools/php.sh`
- Added `labelledBigText` and related
- Cleaned up and added `decoration.sh` and refactored items from `text.sh`
- MAJOR change in semantics to `usageTemplate` - basically will only output the usage template if you use `exitCode` `0` or `2` - aka `errorArgument`
