# Release v0.3.5

- Added support for Darwin `tar` for `build-setup.sh` (`--include` on Darwin, `--wildcards` `pattern` on **Unix**)
- Fixed `urlParse` which was not working
- Added `aws-ip-access.sh` to support access to AWS resources from build
- Fixed incorrect `.gitignore` which was ignoring `bin/build`
