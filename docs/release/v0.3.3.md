# Release v0.3.3

- Upgrade from v0.3.2
- Build step in `github-release.sh` is less verbose and just outputs the HTML link for the release when completed
- `bin/build/build-setup.sh` should be better about self-update and detects it properly. `testBuildSetup` added to testing.
- Test will fix itself after new live version is run (loads from production version 2nd time)
