# Release v0.10.4

- `debuggingStack -s` added for quieter output
- Moved `crontabApplicationSync` into its own file (now also depends on all of `bin/build`)
- `statusMessage` supports any arguments now
- `diff -q` actually outputs stdout so supressed it when needed, in `copyFile` and `copyFileWouldChange`
- `crontab` and related tests
- `saveErrorExit` and `restoreErrorExit` were a lie - tests confirm not inherited by subshells so not ever useful
- `identicalCheck` and `identicalRepair` now support the feature to use the count `EOF` instead of a number - for dedicated identical files this saves generating the counts and screwing it up.
- `crontabApplicationSync` -> `crontabApplicationUpdate`
- Added `whichExiats`
- Consistent use of `whichExiats`
- Cleaned up assertion output and display, added helpers
- Identical code break into smaller files
- `install-bin-build.sh` changed its semantics to modifying the last line of the file. It also now uses `installInstallBuild` post-install to update its own binary.
- `installInstallBuild` now supports `--local` and modifies the installation file based on the version
- `usageArgumentString` now outputs the value if it succeeds
- Changing code to use more `foo=$(__usageEnvironment "$usage" getSomeValue) || return $?` and less `foo=$(__usageEnvironment "$usage" getSomeValue) || __failEnvironment "$usage" getSomeValue || return $?`
- Added `_clean` to `sugar.sh` allow for file deletion upon exit easily
- Added `_code` to `sugar.sh` for singular error codes
- `crontabApplicationUpdate` incorrectly checked mapper for execution (+x) and not for `isCallable` (binary or function)
- `argumentIndex` added to `example.sh`
- `usageMissingArgument` -> `usageArgumentMissing`
- `usageUnknownArgument` -> `usageArgumentUnknown`
- Refactored `_assert.sh` to have a single core assertion function - in progress
- Most `assertFoo` functions now support `--line "$LINENO"`
- Added `BUILD_NPM_VERSION.sh` environment file
- `usageDocument` now disables debugging solely for the template output to enable better error handling
- Added `gitUninstall`, `pythonUninstall`, `dockerComposeUninstall`, `npmUninstall`, `phpUninstall`, `prettierUninstall`, `terraformUninstall`
- Refactored `identical`
- Added sugar function `_clean` used to delete files or directories upon exit with an error code
- Added `aptKeyRemove`, `aptKeyAdd` to `apt.sh`
- Added `aptKeyRemoveHashicorp`
- Removed `trimSpacePipe`
- Updated documentation
- Fixed `gitInstallHooks` to have correct usage
- Added and updated sugar tests
