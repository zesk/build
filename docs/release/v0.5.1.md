# Release v0.5.1

- Upgrade from v0.5.0
- Minor docs updates
- `bin/new-release.sh` fix to handle upgrade correctly, added `--non-interactive` flag
- Renamed `stripWhitespace` to `trimSpacePipe` to be closer to `trimSpace` and to use the `Pipe` suffix
- Not sure if `thingPipe` suffix is best naming concept but we'll see
