# Release v0.5.1

- Upgrade from v0.5.0
- Minor docs updates
- `bin/new-release.sh` fix to handle upgrade correctly, added `--non-interactive` flag
- Renamed `stripWhitespace` to `trimSpacePipe` to be closer to `trimSpace` and to use the `Pipe` suffix
- Not sure if `thingPipe` suffix is best naming concept but we'll see
- `bin/build/install-bin-build.sh` - Build setup
- Added `oldestFile`, `newestFile`, `isOldestFile`, `isNewestFile` tools for modification date comparisons
- Semantics of `assertGreaterThan` and `assertLessThan` (and `OrEqual` variants) were confusing so changed to `leftValue` and `rightValue` so it's clear what the comparison is happening.
- `test.sh` changes back to the test directory (app directory) after each test in case tests `cd`
- Organized `assert.sh` a little
- `identical-check.sh` now outputs the file name of single entries
