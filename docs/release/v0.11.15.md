# Release v0.11.15

- Added `extractTarFilePattern` to do more platform-agnostic tar stuff
- `makeShellFilesExecutable` was a no-op with no arguments, it now operates in the current directory
- Added `tar.sh`
- Added `bashDebuggerEnable` `bashDebuggerDisable` and `bashDebug` for simple debugging
- Working on `bashCoverage` and testing (not ready yet)
- Added `manPathCleanDuplicates`
- bashCoverage seems to work
