# Release v0.7.9

- Added `githubRelease` and `githubLatestRelease`
- Moved `cannon` into core code, so `cannon.sh` is now just a wrapper, improved output quality
- Changed semantics of `cannon` to return 0 if no files match
- Renamed `need``AWSEnvironment` to `awsHasEnvironment` and reversed the semantics (e.g. `! need``AWSEnvironment == awsHasEnvironment`)
- Added `statusMessage` to `deprecated.sh` and cleaned up a little
- Added `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_DATE` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` to `bin/build/env` directory
- awsIsKeyUpToDate
- fixing colors
- Fixed `hasColors` in `install-bin-build-sh` to work in pipelines
- Fixing `isUpToDate` tests
- support non-TTY CI better
- `consoleGetColor` fixes for non-tty
- `phpTest` moved to `php.sh` and all `pipeline/*.sh` files are now just wrappers - this will be deprecated
