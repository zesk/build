# Release v0.11.2

- Fixing `install-bin-build.sh` issue with moving failure in `_installBinBuildDirectory` (incorrect test)
- Added `--help` conformity throughout the project (need to test still)
- `_environmentOutput` -> `outputTrigger`
- Added `buildHome`
- Added `buildFunctions`
- Added test for `labeledBigText`
- color updates for dark
- Added `simplifyPath` as apparently `realPath` only works on files which exist
