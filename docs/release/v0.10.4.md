# Release v0.10.4

- `debuggingStack -s` added for quieter output
- Moved `crontabApplicationSync` into its own file (now also depends on all of `bin/build`)
- `statusMessage` supports any arguments now
- `diff -q` actually outputs stdout so supressed it when needed, in `copyFile` and `copyFileWouldChange`
