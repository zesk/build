# Release v0.23.0

## Breaking changes

- `usageGenerator` now does not convert to markdown, if you used this change globally: `usageGenerator` -> `usageGenerator | simpleMarkdownToConsole | trimTail`
- `_code test` was reassigned to `_code assert` and the code (116) is used instead for `_code timeout` (letter `t`)

## Features and fixes

- Added documentation for [Interfaces](https://www.github.com/zesk/build/docs/tools/interface.md)
- Refactored `usage` formatting into its own file
- Added `notify`, `documentation-complete`, `documentation-error` hooks which are run by `documentationBuild`
- You can override these on a per-project basis
- `darwinNotification` now uses a sound by default
- Documentation/usage now defaults to something sensible
