# Release v0.23.0

Attempts to be consistent with environment variable naming: `_HOME` for directory roots, `_DIRS` for search paths.
## Breaking changes

- `usageGenerator` now does not convert to markdown, if you used this change globally: `usageGenerator` -> `usageGenerator | simpleMarkdownToConsole | trimTail`
- `_code test` was reassigned to `_code assert` and the code (116) is used instead for `_code timeout` (letter `t`)
- `applicationHome` now stores its state file in `$HOME/.build`
- `BUILD_CACHE` is deprecated, use `XDG_STATE_HOME`
- `APPLICATION_REMOTE_PATH` -> `APPLICATION_REMOTE_HOME`
- Files are now stored in new locations
- `BUILD_ENVIRONMENT_PATH` -> `BUILD_ENVIRONMENT_DIRS`
- `BUILD_HOOK_PATH` -> `BUILD_HOOK_DIRS`
