# Release v0.4.6

- `deploy-to.sh` fails if `~/.ssh` is not created, will now create the directory if needed to populate a `known_hosts`
- `deploy-to.sh` does not require `known_hosts` file to exist first
- Fixed `deploy-to.sh` to support better state management, and do not overwrite production values
- Changed structure of deploy directory
