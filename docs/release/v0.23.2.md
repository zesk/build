# Release v0.23.2

Added feature `--tag` in Bash tests.

- Added `--show-tags`, `--tag` and `--skip-tag` to `testSuite` and tagged tests with `# Tag: package-install` and others to speed up builds which take forever
- Test tags added to tests, try `bin/test.sh --list-tags` to filter
- `interactiveBashSource` no longer stores `.approved` files in your project and instead uses `sha` hashes of the files and stores them in `XDG_STATE_HOME`. Cleaner. Affects `project-activate` hooks.
- removing `.approved` from `.gitignore` due to changes in `interactiveBashSource`
- `.debugging` markers are also obsolete - place a tag in the file called `Debugging: hash` which marks the file as valid for debugging functionality.
- `.check-assertions` now runs from project root
