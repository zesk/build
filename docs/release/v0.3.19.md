# Release v0.3.19

- Added fixes for environment missing in `deploy-to.sh` - `$APPLICATION_GIT_SHA` was not set
- Changed semantics of `BUILD_DEBUG` so that 2 or 3 means more super verbose (SSH/SFTP connection)
- Added `sshishDeployActions` to handle verbosity in `deploy-to.sh`
- Added `BUILD_VERSION_CREATED_EDITOR` and `EDITOR` support in `version-created.sh`
- `deploy-to.sh` added new flag `--deploy $APPLICATION_CHECKSUM` to pass remote checksum for application package, now requires `APPLICATION_CHECKSUM`
- `php-build.sh` now adds `APPLICATION_CHECKSUM` and `APPLICATION_TAG` to `.build.env`
- If you want to support your own `APPLICATION_TAG` and or `APPLICATION_CHECKSUM` method which does not use `git` - then generate these values in your `make-env` hook.
- Removed references to `BITBUCKET` in build
