# Release v0.10.0

- Minor cleanup of `sshAddKnownHost` to use sugar
- Typo in `deployBuildEnvironment` error handler
- added `deploy` pipeline to test deployments
- `deployment.sh` updates and reassess, refactor unwind and code clean
- Adding `gitPreCommitShellFiles` and `gitInstallHook`
- Added `--fill` and `--width` to `wrapLines`
- Added `usage` fix to tests which modify locals and made locals harder to clobber in `test.sh`
- Semantics of `isFunction` changed - now supports **builtins** (e.g. `source` or `echo`) - notably does NOT support `.` as this represents the current directory and can instead use `source` seamlessly.. 
- Error handling added to `runCount`, `serviceToStandardPort` and `serviceToPort`
- `gitCommit` error codes were updated to be argument -> environment and vice versa in a few cases
- `_environmentOutput` added to check output and error appropriately
- `documentationTests` modify local variable `usage` variable which caused odd errors - fixed by not requiring the global
- Added `wrapLines --fill` to test decorations
- `dumpFile` added support for `BUILD_DEBUG_LINES`
- `BUILD_DEBUG_LINES` added to support changing debugging output in `dumpFile`
- Killed `IDENTICAL this_usage 4` instead using `local usage="_${FUNCNAME[0]}"` as it's more compact
- Removed `prefixLines` - use `wrapLines`
- Added `gitFindHome` to find git home directory
- Cleaned up `os.sh` and sugared the code 
- `sugar.sh` now validates arguments `isInteger` `isFunction` `isCallable` for arguments - much easier to find errors
- Added `dumpPipe` pair to `dumpFile`, both now support `--symbol` to change the bug symbol if desired
- Lots of new features for release
- Adding `gitInstallHook` `--verbose` option and cleaner output
- Adding `extensionLists` utility for git file processing by type
- `directoryIsEmpty` and `assertDirectoryEmpty` and `assertDirectoryNotEmpty` added
- `escapeDoubleQuotes` and `escapeBash` now output a newline 
- Added `quoteGrepPattern`
- Added `incrementor` utiltiy and `utilties.sh` for generic utilities
- `trimSpacePipe` is now deprecated and `trimSpace` should be used in its place, it will be removed shortly.
- `tput cols` MAY set `COLUMNS` or `LINES` in `consoleColumns` FYI
- Removed most stray `local` or `export`s created as side effects 
- Added `__loader` for loading consistently in hooks, etc.
- lots of work
- Removing newlines from test output and using more
