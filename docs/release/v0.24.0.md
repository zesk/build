# Release v0.24.0

Added feature `--tag` in Bash tests. Added `bashPromptMarkers` and `iTerm2` integration.

- Added `--show-tags`, `--tag` and `--skip-tag` to `testSuite` and tagged tests with `# Tag: package-install` and others to speed up builds which take forever
- Test tags added to tests, try `bin/test.sh --list-tags` to filter
- `interactiveBashSource` no longer stores `.approved` files in your project and instead uses `sha` hashes of the files and stores them in `XDG_STATE_HOME`. Cleaner. Affects `project-activate` hooks.
- removing `.approved` from `.gitignore` due to changes in `interactiveBashSource`
- `.debugging` markers are also obsolete - place a tag in the file called `Debugging: hash` which marks the file as valid for debugging functionality.
- `.check-assertions` files are deprecated, just checks all shell files
- Renamed `joinArguments` -> `listJoin`
- Renamed `listTokens` -> `mapTokens`
- New files `map.sh` and `list.sh` `user.sh` and `host.sh`
- Fixed `consoleColumns` finally, I think (get it directly from `/dev/tty` and do not assume stdin is `/dev/tty` as it is not in a pipe)
- Added direct `iTerm2` shell and prompt integration as `bash-preexec.sh` has an undefined error in `COMP_LINE` on `set +u` which doesn't work for this library. Plus it seems quite messy for something simple which we provided and can integration into `bashPromptUser` to wrap `read` properly.
- Added `bashPromptUser`
- Added `hostnameFull`
- Added `iTerm2Attention` `iTerm2Aliases` `iTerm2PromptSupport`
- new cool colors feature
- Added `__BUILD_HAS_TTY` environment and `isTTYAvailable` to surpress `/dev/tty` access errors in pipeline
