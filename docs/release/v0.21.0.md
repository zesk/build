# Release v0.21.0

- copyright technically starts from starting year, change this logic everywhere
- Deprecated script was broken, fixed

## Breaking changes

- A version of `install-bin-build.sh` in a recent release (`v0.20.2`?) would fail and copy a file to your home directory. Skip to this version or update the script manually.
- Changed `runHook` to `hookRun`
- Added `hookSource`
- `project-activate` and `project-deactivate` hooks are now run as `hookSource` to allow for changing of the shell context
- Major enhancements to `confirmYesNo` and the `interactive.sh` code base (timers, cleaner output)
