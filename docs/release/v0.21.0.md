# Release v0.21.0

- copyright technically starts from starting year, change this logic everywhere
- Deprecated script was broken, fixed and cleaned up majorly
- Deprecated is now stored in a text file delimited with `|` (see `deprecated.txt`)
- `consoleColumns` does not work well with `tput cols` (can not mute errors) â€“ using `stty size` instead (more reliable?)
- Fixed issue with `decorate reset` not outputting correct stop character
- Enhanced `dumpBinary` to add nice labels like `dumpBinary` (Probably should merge these)
- Some bash test caused race condition failure in CI pipeline (`bash.env` example) now can not run at 11:59pm on new year's eve only.
- Added `--version-function` to `_installRemotePackage` to make installing faster and more efficient
- Added `hookSource` and `hookSourceOptional`
- `install-bin-build.sh` now fails more elegantly when `jq` is not available
- `decorate each` is now part of the core `_colors.sh` library
- `__help usageFunction "$@"` added for adding help to simple functions
- `__fetch` added to split dependency on `wget` or `curl`

## Breaking changes

- A version of `install-bin-build.sh` in a recent release (`v0.20.2`?) would fail and copy a file to your home directory. Skip to this version or update the script manually.
- Changed `runHook` to `hookRun`
- `project-activate` and `project-deactivate` hooks are now run as `hookSource` to allow for changing of the shell context (e.g. your `PATH` and shell defined variables and functions)
- Major enhancements to `confirmYesNo` and the `interactive.sh` code base (timers, cleaner output)
- ` --env ` vs ` --env-file ` is now consistent and fully deprecated, so `--env` is no longer considered a deprecated flag. `--env` is for NAME=value and `--env-file` is for files consistently now.

### `--env` for environment files iis now deprecated and will break

Use the replacement `--env-file`:

- `documentationTemplateFunctionCompile --env envFile` is NOW OBSOLETE (and will not work)
- `crontabApplicationUpdate --env envFile` is NOW OBSOLETE (and will not work)
- `documentationTemplateCompile --env envFile` is NOW OBSOLETE (and will not work)
