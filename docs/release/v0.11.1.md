## Notes

- tput fix hope
- `argument.sh` added

- Started `_arguments` work
- Tools are loaded from a list in `bin/build/tools/tools.conf`
- `_return` is no longer duplicated in `_sugar` and is part of `tools.sh` - if you use `_sugar.sh` in your projects ensure a copy of `_return` is available or add one.
- `_code` code has been made more compact
- `_integer` and `_boolean` are part of `_sugar.sh`
- `identical-repair.sh` supports a singles file located in `identical/singles.txt` by default

- Initial version of `sshSetup` added
- `_code` now takes case-insensitive arguments
- `identicalRepair` now takes `--token` so we can have tokens which are flags as well for arguments templates (e.g. `--help`)
- adding success to formatter
- Create `file.sh` and `directory.sh`, `environment.sh` and updated docs and indexes
- `pathAppend` -> `listAppend` and it is actually a text function
