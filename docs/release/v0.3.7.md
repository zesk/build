# Release v0.3.7

- Upgrade from v0.3.6
- Renamed `release-check-version.sh` to `git-tag-version.sh` as it's more what it does
- `git-tag-version.sh` semantics changed and instead just uses `--suffix` to tag stuff differently (no longer uses `--develop` or `--production`)
- Added build environment variable `BUILD_MAXIMUM_TAGS_PER_VERSION`
- Added `docs/env.md` to cover environment variables used in the build scripts
- Added version configuration for `npm` and `composer` (see `env.md`)
