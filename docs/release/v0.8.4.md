# Release v0.8.4

- `copyFileChanged` was designed poorly. Need to test for errors. Not sure how it ever worked - removed.
- `copyFile` and `copyFileWouldChange` replace `copyFileChanged`. Fixed output formatting as well. 
- `copyFileChangedQuiet` is semantically identical now to `copyFile` so it is now deprecated.
- daemontools cleanup and sugar docs
- `process.sh` added, `processWait` and `daemontools` additions
- Added `--exclude` to `identicalCheck` (FINALLY!)
- Added automatic `title` generation in docs (whee!)
- fixing quoteSedPattern to work in both escape interpretations
- fixing section
- `BUILD_COLORS` now is `true` or `false` once configured
- test passing
