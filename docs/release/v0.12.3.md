# Release v0.12.3

- `identicalRepair` used to fail when a directory existed with the name `identical` and no matching files
- Added `APPLICATION_CODE`
- `documentationBuild` now uses a cache directory using `$APPLICATION_CODE` to avoid pollution between projects
- added `buildEnvironmentLoad` test (found a bug in `MANPATH.sh`)
