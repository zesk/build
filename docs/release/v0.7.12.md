# Release v0.7.12

- `dockerEnvToBash` supports reading from `stdin` now (tested)
- Updated tests
- Added `buildEnvironmentLoad`
- All references to `bin/build/env` and `bin/env` removed
- Added `escapeBash` to handle `characterClassReport` correctly
- Default values for env files is now `:-` not `-` to support blank and null
- figured out `bash` scoping a little better, avoid `declare -x`
