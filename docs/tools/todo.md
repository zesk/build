- APPLICATION_ID - Version to be deployed

### `deployToRemote` - Deploy current application to one or more hosts

Deploy current application to host at applicationPath.

If this fails it will output the installation log.

When this tool succeeds the application:

- `--deploy` - has been deployed in the remote systems successfully but temporary files may still exist
- `--revert` - No changes should have occurred on the remote host (not guaranteed)
- `--cleanup` - has been installed in the remote systems successfully

Operation:

## Deploy `--deploy` Operation

- On each host, `app.tar.gz` is uploaded to the `applicationPath` first
- On each host, via the shell, change to the `applicationPath` directory
- Decompress the application package, and run the `deploy-remote-finish.sh` script

## Cleanup `--cleanup` Operation

- On each host, via the shell, change to the `applicationPath` directory
- Run the `deploy-remote-finish.sh` script which ...
- Deletes the application package if it still exists, and runs the `deploy-cleanup` hook

## Undo `--revert` Operation

- On each host, via the shell, change to the `applicationPath` directory
- Run the `deploy-remote-finish.sh` script which ...
- Deploys the prior version in the same manner, and ... <!-- needs expansion TODO -->
- Runs the `deploy-revert` hook afterwards

The `userAtHost` can be passed as follows:

    deployDeployAction --deploy 5125ab12 /var/www/DEPLOY/coolApp/ /var/www/apps/coolApp/ "www-data@host0 www-data@host1 stageuser@host3" "www-data@host4"

- `--versions - deployHome` - Required. Path. Remote path where we can store deployment state files.

- `--application applicationPath` - Required. Path. Path where the application will be deployed
- `userAtHost` - Required. Strings. A list of space-separated values or arguments which match users at remote hosts. Due to shell quoting peculiarities you can pass in space-delimited arguments as single arguments.

#### Exit codes

- `0` - Always succeeds

#### Local cache

`deployHome` is considered a state directory so removing entries in this should be managed separately.
