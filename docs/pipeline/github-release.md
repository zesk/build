# `github-release.sh` - Generate a release on GitHub using API

[â¬… Return to top](index.md)

Use GitHub API to generate a release

GitHub MUST have two sets of credentials enabled:

- The SSH key for the deployment robot should have push access to the repository on GitHub to enable releases (git handles this)
- The `token` must have the permission to create releases for this repository

Think of them of the "source" (user) and "target" (ssh key) access. Both must exist to work.

## Arguments

- `--token token` - Optional. Uses `GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN` if not supplied. Access token for GitHub REST API.
- `--owner owner` - Optional. Uses `GITHUB_REPOSITORY_OWNER` if not supplied. Repository owner of release.
- `--name name` - Optional. Uses `GITHUB_REPOSITORY_NAME` if not supplied. Repository name to release.
- `--expire expireString` - Optional. Uses `GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE` if not supplied. Expiration time for the token.
- `descriptionFilePath` - Required. File which exists. Path to file containing release notes (typically markdown)
- `releaseName` - Required. String. Name of the release (e.g. `v1.0.0`)
- `commitish` - Required. String. The GIT short SHA tag for the release

## Exit codes

- `0` - Always succeeds

## Environment

GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN - Access to GitHub to publish releases
GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE - Date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format which represents the date when `GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN` expires (required)
GITHUB_REPOSITORY_OWNER - Owner of the repository (`https://github.com/owner`)
GITHUB_REPOSITORY_NAME - Name of the repository (`https://github.com/owner/name`)
